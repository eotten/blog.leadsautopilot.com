## What Are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-Degree Connections on LinkedIn?
- **1st-Degree Connections**: These are people you are directly connected to on LinkedIn.
- **2nd-Degree Connections**: These users are not directly connected to you, but they share a mutual connection with someone you know.
- **3rd-Degree Connections**: These users are not in your network, but they are connected to your 2nd-degree connections.

## How to Cancel Connection Requests on LinkedIn
If you send many connection requests but few are accepted, LinkedIn might see you as a spammer. This can hurt your outreach efforts. Here are two solutions:
- Target the right people and send reasonable connection requests to maximize acceptance.
- Delete connection requests older than 3-4 weeks.

To delete an old connection request:
1. Go to **My Network** -> **Manage**.
2. Click on **Sent** -> Withdraw the request you want to cancel.
3. Confirm your decision in the pop-up.

## Will Someone Know If I Withdraw a LinkedIn Invitation?
No, LinkedIn does not notify users when you withdraw a connection request. However, they may notice that the request has disappeared. If they already accepted your invitation, you can still remove them as a connection. Once you withdraw an invitation, you cannot undo this action.

## Do LinkedIn Connection Requests Expire?
Yes, connection requests expire. They automatically expire six months after being sent if not accepted. This policy helps LinkedIn keep its database current by removing old invitations, especially those linked to inactive email addresses.

## What Is the Difference Between Connect and Follow on LinkedIn?
1. **Connect**: When you connect with someone, you can see each other's posts and updates on your feed. You can also send messages.
2. **Follow**: Following someone lets you see their posts and articles on your homepage without being connected.

## How Many LinkedIn Connections Are Normal?
On LinkedIn:
- 54% of users have fewer than 500 connections.
- 27% have between 500 and 999.
- 12% have between 1,000 and 1,999.
- 3% have between 2,000 and 2,999.

If you add 400 new connections monthly, you can be in the top 3% in just over seven months. More connections often lead to higher engagement, like likes, shares, and comments.

## Why Can't I See My 3rd-Degree Connections on LinkedIn?
Sometimes, when you search for people, you may encounter profiles where:
- You can't see their name or access their profiles.
- The "Connect" button is missing.
- You see an "Out of Network" message if you click on their profile.

These users have chosen to limit their visibility in their Privacy Settings, preventing you from sending them connection requests. To connect, you need to connect with some of their connections or engage in similar LinkedIn groups or events. A referral may be necessary.
