LinkedIn has set new limits on how many connection requests you can send. You can now send only 100 to 200 requests each week. However, there are effective ways to work around this limitation.

## 1. Reach Out to Open Profiles  

Open Profiles are premium LinkedIn users who allow you to send them free InMails. You don't need to be connected to message them. This means you can directly contact them even if they are 2nd or 3rd degree connections. For more details, check out this informative video on how to find and message open profiles.

## 2. Message Group Members and Event Attendees  

Another way to send messages on LinkedIn without connecting is by reaching out to group members and event attendees. If you are in a LinkedIn group, you can send direct messages to other members without needing to connect first. LinkedIn sees membership in the same group as a valid reason to start a conversation.

The same applies to LinkedIn events. Once you join an event, you can access all the attendees. To view the list, click on the "Networking Tab." You will find a "Message" button next to each profile. 

Keep in mind, however, that your messages will go to the Message Request section, not the main Inbox. 

By using these strategies with LeadsAutopilot, you can effectively expand your network despite LinkedIn's limitations.
