To increase your chances of getting your connection requests accepted, you must personalize your messages. Sending the same message to everyone won't work. Here are the dos and don'ts of connecting with LinkedIn members.

## 1. What to Avoid When Contacting LinkedIn Members

LinkedIn etiquette suggests that your first contact should be with someone you already know. You only get one chance to make a good first impression. Here are two common mistakes people make:

- **No Personalization**: Many people send generic connection requests. I receive dozens of these every week. If you don't put in the effort, others won't either.
  
- **Selling Too Soon**: Trying to close a deal right away without building a relationship first is a mistake. Before asking for anything, offer something valuable. Why would someone book a meeting or fill out a form for a stranger? 

## 2. What to Do When Sending a LinkedIn Connection Request

Here's my top advice: add a note only if it's very relevant. If you can't think of anything meaningful to say, don't add a note. Requests without notes often get accepted more than those with notes because most notes are poorly written.

If you do include a note:
- **Personalize It**: Focus on them, not yourself.
- **Keep It Short**: Get to the point quickly.

For example, if your message starts with your company name, it shows you know what they do. You should ask to connect, not sell. Avoid discussing your product or service.

This is a great way to send hyper-personalized LinkedIn messages. 

**Pro Tip**: If possible, make them feel like you could be a potential client. This approach piques interest, as it did for me when I received a similar message.

## 3. What If My LinkedIn Connection Request Is Not Accepted?

Even with a great note, over 50% of connection requests may still be ignored. Don't give up on those individuals. Instead, try to find their email addresses.

Use LeadsAutopilot to export Sales Navigator leads. You won't have access to the emails of your 2nd and 3rd-degree connections on LinkedIn. If you're using LinkedIn for lead generation, you should definitely utilize LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find potential leads. In the video above, I demonstrate how to build email lists from LinkedIn Sales Navigator in just two clicks.
