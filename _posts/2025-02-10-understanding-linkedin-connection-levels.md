LinkedIn uses connection levels to show how closely you are connected to other professionals. Knowing these levels can help you grow your network and improve your interactions on the platform. Here's a breakdown of the different connection degrees:

## 1st-Degree Connections

These are people you are directly connected to on LinkedIn. You either sent them a connection request or accepted theirs. You'll see a "1st" icon next to their name. With 1st-degree connections, you can access their contact details, like emails and phone numbers. LinkedIn allows a maximum of 30,000 1st-degree connections per member. To check contact details, click on "contact info," but remember, not everyone shares their information:
- About 30% share their emails.
- About 5% share their phone numbers.
- About 15% share their Twitter handles.
  
If you want someone's contact info, it's best to connect with them first. Alternatively, you can use LeadsAutopilot for more efficient prospecting.

## 2nd-Degree Connections

These are people connected to your 1st-degree connections but not to you directly. You can view their profiles, but you need to send a connection request to interact. You can see mutual connections above the "Connect" button on their profile. If you want to message them without connecting first, you can use LinkedIn InMail. InMails are paid messages available to premium subscribers, such as those with LinkedIn Premium or Sales Navigator. InMails are great for reaching out to job candidates and showing your interest in them.

## 3rd-Degree Connections

These individuals are connected to your 2nd-degree contacts. You'll see a "3rd" icon next to their names. To connect, click "More" under their profile picture to find the "Connect" option. You can also use InMails to reach out to them if you have a premium account. If you don't have premium access, you can still message 2nd and 3rd-degree connections if you share a group or event.

## 3rd+ Connections

These are individuals you are not connected to at all and do not share any mutual contacts with. There is a gap of more than two people between you and them.

Now that you understand LinkedIn's connection levels, you can use this knowledge to expand your network and connect with more professionals effectively.
