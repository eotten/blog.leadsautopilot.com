LinkedIn uses connection levels to show how closely you are connected to other professionals. Knowing these levels can help you grow your network and improve your interactions on the platform. Here’s a breakdown of the different connection degrees:

- **1st-Degree Connections**: These are people you are directly connected to on LinkedIn. You either sent them a connection request or accepted theirs. You’ll see a “1st” icon next to their name. With 1st-degree connections, you can access their contact details, like emails and phone numbers. LinkedIn allows a maximum of 30,000 1st-degree connections per member. To check contact details, click on “contact info,” but remember, not everyone shares their information:
  - About 30% share their emails.
  - About 5% share their phone numbers.
  - About 15% share their Twitter handles.
  
  If you want someone's contact info, it’s best to connect with them first. Alternatively, you can use LeadsAutopilot for more efficient prospecting. With features like **Auto Likes**, which automatically likes posts from your target audience and can reach up to 180,000 people monthly, LeadsAutopilot helps you expand your visibility and engage with potential connections effortlessly.

- **2nd-Degree Connections**: These are people connected to your 1st-degree connections but not to you directly. You can view their profiles, but you need to send a connection request to interact. You can see mutual connections above the “Connect” button on their profile. If you want to message them without connecting first, you can use LinkedIn InMail. InMails are paid messages available to premium subscribers, such as those with LinkedIn Premium or Sales Navigator. InMails are great for reaching out to job candidates and showing your interest in them.

- **3rd-Degree Connections**: These individuals are connected to your 2nd-degree contacts. You’ll see a “3rd” icon next to their names. To connect, click “More” under their profile picture to find the “Connect” option. You can also use InMails to reach out to them if you have a premium account. If you don’t have premium access, you can still message 2nd and 3rd-degree connections if you share a group or event.

- **3rd+ Connections**: These are individuals you are not connected to at all and do not share any mutual contacts with. There is a gap of more than two people between you and them.

Now that you understand LinkedIn's connection levels, you can use this knowledge to expand your network and connect with more professionals effectively.

# How to Connect with Anyone on LinkedIn

To increase your chances of getting your connection requests accepted, you must personalize your messages. Sending the same message to everyone won't work. Here are the dos and don’ts of connecting with LinkedIn members.

## 1. What to Avoid When Contacting LinkedIn Members

LinkedIn etiquette suggests that your first contact should be with someone you already know. You only get one chance to make a good first impression. Here are two common mistakes people make:

- **No Personalization**: Many people send generic connection requests. I receive dozens of these every week. If you don’t put in the effort, others won’t either.
  
- **Selling Too Soon**: Trying to close a deal right away without building a relationship first is a mistake. Before asking for anything, offer something valuable. Why would someone book a meeting or fill out a form for a stranger? 

## 2. What to Do When Sending a LinkedIn Connection Request

Here’s my top advice: add a note only if it’s very relevant. If you can’t think of anything meaningful to say, don’t add a note. Requests without notes often get accepted more than those with notes because most notes are poorly written.

If you do include a note:
- **Personalize It**: Focus on them, not yourself.
- **Keep It Short**: Get to the point quickly.

For example, if your message starts with your company name, it shows you know what they do. You should ask to connect, not sell. Avoid discussing your product or service.

This is a great way to send hyper-personalized LinkedIn messages. 

**Pro Tip**: If possible, make them feel like you could be a potential client. This approach piques interest, as it did for me when I received a similar message.

## 3. What If My LinkedIn Connection Request Is Not Accepted?

Even with a great note, over 50% of connection requests may still be ignored. Don’t give up on those individuals. Instead, try to find their email addresses.

Use LeadsAutopilot to export Sales Navigator leads. You won’t have access to the emails of your 2nd and 3rd-degree connections on LinkedIn. If you’re using LinkedIn for lead generation, you should definitely utilize LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find potential leads. In the video above, I demonstrate how to build email lists from LinkedIn Sales Navigator in just two clicks.

# How to Overcome LinkedIn's Connection Request Limits

LinkedIn has set new limits on how many connection requests you can send. You can now send only 100 to 200 requests each week. However, there are effective ways to work around this limitation.

1. **Reach Out to Open Profiles**  
   Open Profiles are premium LinkedIn users who allow you to send them free InMails. You don’t need to be connected to message them. This means you can directly contact them even if they are 2nd or 3rd degree connections. For more details, check out this informative video on how to find and message open profiles.

2. **Message Group Members and Event Attendees**  
   Another way to send messages on LinkedIn without connecting is by reaching out to group members and event attendees. If you are in a LinkedIn group, you can send direct messages to other members without needing to connect first. LinkedIn sees membership in the same group as a valid reason to start a conversation.

   The same applies to LinkedIn events. Once you join an event, you can access all the attendees. To view the list, click on the "Networking Tab." You will find a "Message" button next to each profile. 

   Keep in mind, however, that your messages will go to the Message Request section, not the main Inbox. 

By using these strategies with LeadsAutopilot, you can effectively expand your network despite LinkedIn's limitations. With its **Content Scheduler** feature, you can automate your posting schedule, ensuring that your valuable content reaches your audience at the optimal times for maximum engagement.

# How to Increase Your LinkedIn Connection Requests Each Week

LinkedIn has a limit on how many connection requests you can send each week. However, you can send more by improving your LinkedIn Social Selling Index Score (SSI). A higher SSI score allows you to send up to 200 connection requests weekly. Here’s how to enhance your SSI and maximize your LinkedIn outreach:

1. **Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile**  
   Your profile is the first thing people see when they get your connection request. A well-optimized profile boosts your acceptance rate and shows LinkedIn that you are serious about quality networking.

2. **Increase Your Invitation Acceptance Rate**  
   LinkedIn tracks how many of your connection requests are accepted. If many remain pending, LinkedIn may think you are sending low-quality invites, which can limit your ability to send more. Here are some tips to avoid this issue:  
   - Don’t include notes with your requests. Research shows that invites without a message usually have a higher acceptance rate.  
   - Keep your pending requests low by withdrawing unaccepted invitations after a few weeks.  
   - Engage with prospects before connecting. Liking or commenting on their posts can increase the chances of your request being accepted.

3. **Post Valuable Content on LinkedIn**  
   LinkedIn favors users who actively share insights and participate in discussions. Regularly posting high-quality content can raise your SSI score and make your profile more attractive to potential connections.  
   - Share insights, experiences, or industry trends to establish yourself as a thought leader.  
   - Engage with comments and discussions to improve your visibility.  
   - A strong personal brand makes people more likely to accept your requests when they recognize your name.

By following these steps, you can significantly increase your LinkedIn connection requests and enhance your networking efforts. For a seamless experience, consider using LeadsAutopilot, which offers features like **Welcome Messages** that send personalized messages to new connections, making your outreach even more effective.

# The BEST Strategy for LinkedIn Networking

The most effective strategy for LinkedIn networking isn't sending connection requests—it's sending likes. When you like someone's post, they receive a notification and often visit your profile out of curiosity. If they find your content valuable, they're more likely to connect with you organically.

This approach offers several advantages:
- It bypasses connection request limits
- Creates a natural introduction
- Establishes familiarity before connecting
- Positions you as an engaged professional

However, this strategy requires two key elements to succeed:
1. **High-quality content** on your profile that showcases your expertise
2. **Consistent engagement** with many professionals in your target audience

## Automate Your LinkedIn Networking

Manually implementing this strategy can be time-consuming. LeadsAutopilot offers specialized tools designed specifically for this approach:

- **Autolikes**: Automatically engage with up to 180,000 people in your niche every month, generating profile visits and connection opportunities without manual effort
- **Power Writer**: Create and schedule professional, engaging content that converts profile visitors into connections

This combination of automated engagement and quality content creates a powerful networking engine that works while you focus on your business.

### How to Cancel Connection Requests on LinkedIn
If you send many connection requests but few are accepted, LinkedIn might see you as a spammer. This can hurt your outreach efforts. Here are two solutions:
- Target the right people and send reasonable connection requests to maximize acceptance.
- Delete connection requests older than 3-4 weeks.

To delete an old connection request:
1. Go to **My Network** -> **Manage**.
2. Click on **Sent** -> Withdraw the request you want to cancel.
3. Confirm your decision in the pop-up.

### Will Someone Know If I Withdraw a LinkedIn Invitation?
No, LinkedIn does not notify users when you withdraw a connection request. However, they may notice that the request has disappeared. If they already accepted your invitation, you can still remove them as a connection. Once you withdraw an invitation, you cannot undo this action.

### Do LinkedIn Connection Requests Expire?
Yes, connection requests expire. They automatically expire six months after being sent if not accepted. This policy helps LinkedIn keep its database current by removing old invitations, especially those linked to inactive email addresses.

### What Is the Difference Between Connect and Follow on LinkedIn?
1. **Connect**: When you connect with someone, you can see each other’s posts and updates on your feed. You can also send messages.
2. **Follow**: Following someone lets you see their posts and articles on your homepage without being connected.

### How Many LinkedIn Connections Are Normal?
On LinkedIn:
- 54% of users have fewer than 500 connections.
- 27% have between 500 and 999.
- 12% have between 1,000 and 1,999.
- 3% have between 2,000 and 2,999.

If you add 400 new connections monthly, you can be in the top 3% in just over seven months. More connections often lead to higher engagement, like likes, shares, and comments.

### Why Can't I See My 3rd-Degree Connections on LinkedIn?
Sometimes, when you search for people, you may encounter profiles where:
- You can’t see their name or access their profiles.
- The “Connect” button is missing.
- You see an “Out of Network” message if you click on their profile.

These users have chosen to limit their visibility in their Privacy Settings, preventing you from sending them connection requests. To connect, you need to connect with some of their connections or engage in similar LinkedIn groups or events. A referral may be necessary.
